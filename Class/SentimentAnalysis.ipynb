When there are comparable products like the many Foscam cameras with active PTZ, 2 Dropcam versions and a variety of Logitech Alert products, there just isn't much room in the market for a mediocre camera like this. The apps are severely lacking, and it requires a &#34;cloud&#34; account just to use, which means it is impossible to setup somewhere without Internet (like a cabin) and use as a local only monitoring camera.
